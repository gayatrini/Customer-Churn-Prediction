# Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can identify customers likely to churn, helping telecom companies proactively retain their customers.


## Project Steps
### Data Preprocessing:
- Cleaned and prepared the telecom customer dataset.
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables.
  
### Feature Engineering:
-Extracted relevant features and transformed data for model training.

### Handling Class Imbalance:
- Applied SMOTE to address imbalanced classes in customer churn prediction.

### Model Training and Evaluation:
- Utilized the Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn.
- Achieved an accuracy of 94.75%, validating the model's effectiveness.
